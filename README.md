Description
------------------------
A collection of utility classes I wrote over time for various projects (or just for fun).

Don't expect any correlation or extensive API design. ;-)

Usage
-----------------------
Add Import one of the classes, instantiate if nescessary and call the methods you want.

Dependency via Maven
----------------------
This project will never, nor should ever, reach the maven central repo so you'll have install it to your local repo yourself.

Hint:

    mvn clean install

After that include the dependency in your pom.xml dependencies

    <dependency>
        <groupId>nl.salp</groupId>
        <artifactId>salp-util</artifactId>
        <version>0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>
